old-node is old Node.js that is no longer in use.

Web server is http. Flask

fetch contains code to get data

views is old code that will be phased out. From Django

First install Neo4j http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/server-installation.html

Build with pip install -r requirements.txt

runserver with python http/app.py

run fetch code example "python -m magla.fetch.freebase.build"

Done this way so that config file can be used. It is similar to Java
